# JS TRIVIA!

_this is my first game as a developer_
  
TLDR
https://stefaniecespedes.github.io/JS-Trivia/index.html

## What's it about?

The hero of this game is an aspiring developer girl who runs from bugs - otherwise her code crashes and she dies. In the middle of her journey, she finds questions to practice her Javascript knowledge. Everytime she gets a question wrong, she'll lose a life, but the game continues until the lives end!

### Developed with:

* Vanilla JS for the logic behind the game;
* HTML Canvas for the "runner" part of the game;
* DOM Manipulation for the quiz;
* CSS in the quiz area;
